## xtd libraries architecture

[![architecture_logo](pictures/block_diagram_onion.png)](hierarchy.md)

xtd is composed of several libraries grouped by package.

### system

[![core](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.core.png)](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__core.html)
The [xtd.core](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__core.html) library is modern C++17/20 libraries of classes, interfaces, and value types that provide access to system functionality. It is the foundation on which c++ applications, components, and controls are built.

### drawing

[![drawing](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.drawing.png)](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__drawing.html)
The [xtd.drawing](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__drawing.html) library contains types that support basic GDI+ graphics functionality. Child namespaces support advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality, advanced imaging functionality, and print-related and typographical services. A child namespace also contains types that extend design-time user-interface logic and drawing.

### forms

[![forms](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.forms.png)](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__forms.html)
The [xtd.forms](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__forms.html) library contains classes for creating Windows-based applications that take full advantage of the rich user interface features available in the Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and linux base operating system.

### tunit

[![tunit](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/pictures/xtd.tunit.png)](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__tunit.html)
The [xtd.tunit](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/group__xtd__tunit.html) library is a unit-testing framework for modern C++17/20, inspired by [Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.Cpp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/microsoft-visualstudio-testtools-cppunittestframework-api-reference).

# Objectives and Mission

* xtd is a powerful, yet easy to use platform to build your applications upon
* xtd is modular and scalable from embedded applications
* xtd provides consistent, comprehensive and comprehensible programming interfaces
* xtd favors simplicity over complexity ("as simple as possible, but not simpler")
* xtd aims for consistency in [design](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/documentation.md), [coding style](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/coding_conventions_guidelines.md) and [documentation](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/index.html)
* xtd emphasizes source code quality, in terms of readability, comprehensiveness, consistency, style and testability
* xtd aims to make C++ programming fun again Guiding Principles
* Strong focus on code quality, style, consistency and code readability – all code must satisfy our [coding style guide](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/design_guidelines.md)
* Strong focus on tests (automated [unit tests](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/tree/master/tests) with high coverage)
* Build on top of solid foundations – use existing proven C, C++ or Objective-C libraries (e.g. Win32 APi, Gtk4, AppKit,...) where it makes sense

# Getting Started

* [Installation](downloads.md) provides download and install documentation.
* [Guides](guides.md) provides xtd guides and tutorials.
* [Examples](../examples/README.md) provides over 800 examples to help you use xtd, grouped by libraries and topics.
