# Getting and formatting date/time easily

```cpp
#include <xtd/xtd>

auto main() -> int {
  console::write_line(date_time::now().to_long_date_string());
  console::write_line(date_time::now().to_long_time_string());
  console::write_line(date_time::now().to_string("u"));
}
```

# Writing to debug output and console at once

```cpp
#include <xtd/xtd>

auto main() -> int {
  debug::write_line("This goes to console and debug output!");
}
```

Write on console, debug_form, syslog, ... and any listener that you want.
