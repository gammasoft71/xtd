# Introduction

This tutorial will introduce you to the programming with the [xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) framework.

# xtd


* [xtd.core](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) is a library for creating [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) console applications.
* [xtd.forms](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for creating [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) applications.
* [xtd.tunit](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) is a  [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) library for creating [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) unit test applications.

[xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) is an open source and cross-platform framework.

[xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) applications run on all major OS platforms, Windows, Linux and macOS.

# The C++ programming language

The [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) programming language is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is used in many famous desktop applications like MS Office, Macromedia Flash, Firefox, Photoshop or 3D Max. [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) dominates also the world of PC games. It is one of the most difficult programming languages. On the other hand, programming in [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) today is different from programming 10 years ago. There are many tools and libraries that make the programming easier.

# Programming languages

There are currently several widely used programming languages. The following list is based on the [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index) Programming Community Index. The numbers are from October 2022. As we can see, [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) still belongs to the most popular programming languages in the world.

| Position | Language          | Ratings |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 1        | Python            | 17.08%  |
| 2        | C                 | 15.21%  |
| 3        | Java              | 12.84%  |
| 4        | [C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp)     |  9.92%  |
| 5        | C#                |  4.42%  |
| 6        | Visual Basic      |  3.95%  |
| 7        | JavaScript        |  2.74%  |
| 8        | Assembly language |  2.39%  |
| 9        | PHP               |  2.04%  |
| 10       | SQL               |  1.78%  |

C is the most widely used programming language. Every fourth application is programmed in C/[C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp). They are standard for creating operating systems and various desktop applications. C/[C++](/docs/documentation/Portability/cpp) are the most widely used system programming languages.

Java excels in creating portable mobile applications, programming various appliances and in creating enterprise applications. 

C# is the main programming language of the Microsoft .NET platform.

PHP dominates over the Web. While Java is used mainly by large organisations, PHP is used by smaller companies and individuals. PHP is used to create dynamic web applications.

Visual Basic .NET is another popular .NET programming language. It represents the popularity of the RAD (Rapid Application Development).

Python is the most widely used scripting language.

# Multiplatform programming

Today, multiplatform programming is a buzzword. Most languages and libraries want to be multiplatform. xtd.forms was created as a multiplatform tool from the beginning. Most developers choose among these options. If it is possible, they go to the web. Or they can use Qt, wxWidgets, [xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd), Swing, or SWT. The Qt library and wxWidgets are the closest competitors to [xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd).
