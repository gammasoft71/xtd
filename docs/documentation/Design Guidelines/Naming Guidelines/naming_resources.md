# Naming Resources

Because localizable resources can be referenced via certain objects as if they were properties, the naming guidelines for resources are similar to property guidelines.

**✔️ DO** use snake_casing in resource keys.

**✔️ DO** provide descriptive rather than short identifiers.

**❌ DO NOT** use language-specific keywords of the C++ languages.

**✔️ DO** use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in naming resources.

**✔️ DO** use the following naming convention for exception message resources.

The resource identifier should be the exception type name plus a short identifier of the exception:

**argument_exception_illegal_characters**

**argument_exception_invalid_name**

**argument_exception_file_name_is_malformed**
