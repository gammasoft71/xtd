# Importing .Net System.Globalization of into xtd  - Reply by ChatGPT (internal)

I'm thinking of maybe adding an advanced version of CultureInfo as in .Net in xtd. I was thinking, to keep it simple. I could pull in the .Net grace data, consolidate it into a json or xml file and run it through xtd. Do you think this is usable or is it lame?

## Is Your Approach Feasible?

Your idea is far from clumsy! Itâ€™s a clever way to leverage a comprehensive dataset while remaining independent of .NET at runtime. Here are some thoughts to help you validate (or adjust) your plan:

### **Advantages of Your Approach:**
1. **Ease of Integration:**
   - Extracting data from .NET (e.g., via `CultureInfo` and its methods) allows you to immediately benefit from a comprehensive culture database without reinventing the wheel.
   - Consolidating the data into a JSON/XML file simplifies data loading and management.

2. **Independence from .NET:**
   - Once the data is extracted and stored, your implementation in xtd becomes entirely independent of .NET, which is a significant benefit for portability.

3. **Customization Options:**
   - You could add specific features or tweaks in xtd without being constrained by .NETâ€™s API.

4. **Controlled Performance:**
   - Static data (JSON/XML) can be easily cached, minimizing runtime performance impact.

### **Potential Challenges and Solutions:**
1. **Data Volume:**
   - The `CultureInfo` database is substantial. If you export all cultures and their associated formats (numbers, dates, currencies, calendars, etc.), the file might become large.
   - **Solution:**  
     Include only the most common cultures by default and allow optional downloading of additional cultures.

2. **Synchronization with Updates:**
   - Globalization data evolves over time (e.g., new cultures, monetary reforms, etc.).
   - **Solution:**  
     Provide a script or automated tool in xtd to regenerate the JSON/XML file from .NET to keep the data up to date.

3. **Data Access Performance:**
   - Reading and parsing JSON/XML can be slower compared to using an in-memory database.
   - **Solution:**  
     Load the data into an optimized structure in memory (like a `std::unordered_map`) at runtime, or consider using a pre-compiled binary format to speed up loading.

4. **Platform-Specific Differences:**
   - If targeting platforms with unique cultural specifics (e.g., macOS or Linux using ICU), ensure that data extracted from .NET doesnâ€™t create inconsistencies.
   - **Solution:**  
     Cross-check the extracted data with other sources, such as ICU, to avoid surprises on non-Windows platforms.

### **Concrete Steps to Implement This Idea:**
1. **Extract Data from .NET:**
   - Use a C# application to iterate through all available cultures (`CultureInfo.GetCultures(CultureTypes.AllCultures)`) and export the necessary information (date formats, number formats, names, etc.) into a JSON or XML file.

2. **Design a Parser in xtd:**
   - Implement a class (e.g., `xtd::globalization::culture_info`) to load and interpret this data. Include static methods like `culture_info::get_current_culture()` to mimic .NET.

3. **Optimization:**
   - If file size becomes an issue, consider using a custom binary format or including only essential data (e.g., default formats for each culture).

4. **Add Unit Tests:**
   - Verify that the generated formats in xtd match expected results for various cultures (especially for edge cases like decimal numbers, sorting, or calendars).

### **My Opinion:**
This solution is entirely viable, especially if you aim to offer an API similar to .NET. It would fill a gap in C++ while leveraging .NET's comprehensive data. As long as you anticipate challenges related to size and performance, this project could become one of the standout features of xtd. ðŸ˜Š
