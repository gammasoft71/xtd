# What is xtd

`xtd` is an open source developer platform, created by [Gammasoft](https://gammasoft71.wixsite.com/gammasoft), for building many different types of applications.

## xtd

`xtd` is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

With `xtd`, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

## Languages

You can write `xtd` apps in modern **C++17** or above and **C** (For more info about c binding see [xtd_c project](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd_c).

* **C++17** is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language (For more information about c++ see [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)).
* **C** is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe (For more information about c++ see [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)).

## Cross Platform

Whether you're working in **C++17**, or **C**, your code will run natively on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with `xtd`. 
Some are cross-platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices. (For mode information see [portability](/docs/documentation/Portability)).

## One consistent API
