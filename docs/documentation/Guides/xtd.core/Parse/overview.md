# Parse strings in xtd

A parsing operation converts a string that represents a xtd base type into that base type. 
For example, a parsing operation is used to convert a string to a floating-point number or to a date-and-time value.
The method most commonly used to perform a parsing operation is the `parse` method. 
Because parsing is the reverse operation of formatting (which involves converting a base type into its string representation), many of the same rules and conventions apply. 
Just as formatting uses an object that implements the IFormatProvider interface to provide culture-sensitive formatting information, parsing also uses an object that implements the IFormatProvider interface to determine how to interpret a string representation.
