## C++17

xtd support C++17 or above.

As of 2018, C++17 is the name for the most recent revision of the [ISO/IEC 14882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14882) standard for the [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming language.

For more information see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17) and [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/).

## Operating System

* Windows 10 32 or 64 bits or later
* macOS X 10.15 or later
* Linux (compatible with g++10)
* Probably others (if a compatible C++17 compiler is supported and if [xtd.core.native](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/src/xtd.core.native), [xtd.drawing.native](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/src/xtd.drawing.native) and [xtd.form.native](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/src/xtd.forms.native) libraries are ported).
