# Important Announcement: xtd 0.2.0 will require C++20 as the minimum standard!

I’m excited to announce that the upcoming major release, xtd 0.2.0, will require a C++20-compatible compiler at minimum.

Why this change?
	*	C++20 is now mature and widely supported by all modern compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang).
	*	It brings features that make code cleaner, safer, and more efficient.
	*	This lets us simplify xtd’s core by removing workarounds for C++17 and introduce more modern, expressive APIs.

No worries if you’re still using C++17: the v0.1.0-beta xtd branch will remain available for your projects. This update is just a natural step toward embracing modern standards.

And no rush on jumping to C++23 — we prefer to have a solid, stable foundation before moving on to the next step.
