**Posted on June 30, 2025**

Here we are! xtd today reaches a new milestone with its first officially tagged release.

Although the project remains under active development (< 1.0.0), this version marks an important step:
the foundation is now mature and stable enough to be used with confidence.

## Notes

xtd is still under active development.
API changes may still occur until version 1.0.0, but each stable release (like 0.2.0) is considered tested and usable in production with caution.
