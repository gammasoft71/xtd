# Release xtd 0.2.0 â€” First Official Release

**Posted on June 30, 2025**

Here we are! Xtd today reaches a new milestone with the first officially released stable release.
Although the project remains in active development (< 1.0.0), this version marks an important step: 
the base is now sufficiently mature and stable to be used with confidence.

## Key points

*	New image effects system (xtd::drawing::imaging::effects)
*	LINQ-like with xtd::linq::enumerable and xtd::collections::generic::extensions::enumerable<\>
*	Major improvements to the APIs xtd::forms, xtd::drawing, xtd::tunit and xtd::core
*	Ports and tests on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD
*	More than 25,000 unit tests, 850 examples, a complete online doc
*	New target platforms: Haiku partial support (xtd.core + tunit)
* Read the [release note](documentation/release_notes/v0.2.0_release_note.md) for more informations.
* [Installation](downloads.md) provides download and install documentation.
* For more information about all functionalities read the [Reference Guide](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/v0.2.0/index.html).

## Remarks

xtd is still in the active development phase.
API changes can still occur up to version 1.0.0, but each released stable version (such as 0.2.0) is considered tested and usable in production with caution.
