As mentioned in [introdcution](introduction.md) [xtd_forms](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd_forms) is a part of [xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd).

[xtd](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd) and [xtd_forms](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd_forms) consist of a large group of helper classes that help programmers to do their job. These include classes for working with strings, files, streams, console, unit testing, or network. Here we will show only a tiny drop of the whole lake.

[xtd_tunit](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd_tunit) library can be used to create unit testing applications. In this chapter, we will illustrate some of the helper classes in unit testing based applications.
