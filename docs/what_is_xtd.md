# What is xtd

`xtd` is an open source developer platform, created by [Gammasoft](https://gammasoft71.wixsite.com/gammasoft), for building many different types of applications.

## xtd

`xtd` is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

With `xtd`, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

## Languages

You can write `xtd` apps in modern **C++17** or above and **C** (For more info about c binding see [xtd_c project](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd_c).

* **C++17** is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language (For more information about c++ see [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)).
* **C** is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe (For more information about c++ see [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)).

## Cross Platform

Whether you're working in **C++17**, or **C**, your code will run natively on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with `xtd`. 
Some are cross-platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices. (For mode information see [portability](portability.md)).

## One consistent API

`xtd` provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs that are common to all `xtd` applications.

`xtd` has some [tools](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd/blob/master/docs/tools.md) to help you in your development.

## Why choose xtd?

* `xtd` helps you develop high quality applications faster. Modern language constructs like generics, and asynchronous programming make developers productive.
* With `xtd` you can target any application type running on any platform. Developers can reuse skills and code across all of them in a familiar environment. That means developers can build apps faster, with less cost.
* `xtd` is a modern, innovative, open source development platform and developers love it.
* `xtd` is fast. Really fast! That means applications provide better response times and require less compute power.
* `xtd`is [open source](https://github.com/gammasoft71/xtd).
