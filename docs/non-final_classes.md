# Non-final Classes

Final classes cannot be inherited from, and they prevent extensibility. In contrast, classes that can be inherited from are called non-final classes.

**✔️ CONSIDER** using non-final classes with no added virtual or protected members as a great way to provide inexpensive yet much appreciated extensibility to a framework.

Developers often want to inherit from non-final classes so as to add convenience members such as custom constructors, new methods, or method overloads.

Classes are non-final by default in C++, and this is also the recommended default for most classes in frameworks.
The extensibility afforded by non-final types is much appreciated by framework users and quite inexpensive to provide because of relatively low test costs associated with non-final types.
