# Gammasoft is...

* More than thirty years of passion for high technology especially in development (c++, c#, objective-c, ...).

# ... also

* The c++ is my favorite language, naturally followed by c#.
* I love Apple products for their simplicity of use but I also admire the technologies of Microsoft for their efficiency as for example the .Net Framework.
* The name Gammasoft was created by analogy with Microsoft. I know... but I was young at this time.
