  /// @remarks The xtd::date_time value type represents dates and times with values ranging from 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 0001 Anno Domini (Common Era) through 11:59:59 P.M., December 31, 9999 A.D. (C.E.) in the Gregorian calendar.
  /// @remarks Time values are measured in 100-nanosecond units called ticks. A particular date is the number of ticks since 12:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 A.D. (C.E.) in the GregorianCalendar calendar. The number excludes ticks that would be added by leap seconds. For example, a ticks value of 31241376000000000L represents the date Friday, January 01, 0100 12:00:00 midnight. A xtd::date_time value is always expressed in the context of an explicit or default calendar.
  /// @note If you are working with a ticks value that you want to convert to some other time interval, such as minutes or seconds, you should use the xtd::time_span::ticks_per_day, xtd::time_span::ticks_per_hour, xtd::time_span::ticks_per_minute, xtd::time_span::ticks_per_second, or xtd::time_span::ticks_per_millisecond constant to perform the conversion. For example, to add the number of seconds represented by a specified number of ticks to the xtd::date_time::second component of a xtd::date_time value, you can use the expression date_value.second() + n_ticks/timespan.ticks_per_second.
  /// @remarks For more information about types, see [Native types, boxing and unboxing](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/docs/documentation/guides/xtd.core/Types%20overview/types).
  /// For example, a ticks value of 31241376000000000LL represents the date, Friday, January 01, 0100 12:00:00 midnight. A xtd::date_time value is always expressed in the context of an explicit or default calendar.
  /// @par Instantiating a xtd::date_time object
  /// You can create a new xtd::dateTime value in any of the following ways:
  ///    * By calling any of the overloads of the xtd::date_time constructor that allow you to specify specific elements of the date and time value (such as the year, month, and day, or the number of ticks). The following statement illustrates a call to one of the xtd::date_time constructors to create a date with a specific year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
  /// ```cpp
  /// xtd::date_time date1(2008, 5, 1, 8, 30, 52);
  /// ```
  ///
  ///    * By assigning the xtd::date_time object a date and time value returned by a property or method. The following example assigns the current date and time, the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) date and time, and the current date to three new date_time variables.
  /// ```cpp
  /// date_time date1 = date_time::now();
  /// date_time date2 = date_time::utc_now();
  /// date_time date3 = date_time::today();
  /// ```
  ///
  ///    * By parsing the xtd::string representation of a date and time value. The xtd::date_time::parse, xtd::date_time::parse_exact, xtd::date_time::try_parse, and xtd::date_time::try_parse_exact methods all convert a xtd::string to its equivalent date and time value. The following example uses the xtd::date_time::parse method to parse a xtd::string and convert it to a xtd::date_time value.
  /// ```cpp
  /// string date_string = "5/1/2008 8:30:52";
  /// date_time date1 = date_time::parse(date_string);
  /// ```
  /// Note that the xtd::date_time::try_parse and xtd::date_time::try_parse_exact methods indicate whether a particular xtd::string contains a valid representation of a xtd::date_time value in addition to performing the conversion.
  ///
  ///    * By calling the xtd::date_time structure's implicit default constructor. The following example illustrates a call to the xtd::date_time implicit default constructor.
  /// ```cpp
  /// date_time dat1;
  /// // The following method call displays 1/01/0001 00:00:00.
  /// console::write_line(dat1.to_string());
  /// // The following method call displays `true`.
  /// console::write_line(dat1.equals(date_time::min_value));
