  /// The following example saves the values of the xtd::console_color enumeration to an array and stores the current values of the xtd::background_color and xtd::foreground_color properties to variables. It then changes the foreground color to each color in the xtd::console_color enumeration except to the color that matches the current background, and it changes the background color to each color in the xtd::console_color enumeration except to the color that matches the current foreground. (If the foreground color is the same as the background color, the text isn't visible.) Finally, it calls the xtd:::reset_color class to restore the original console colors.

To change the background color of the console window as a whole, set the BackgroundColor property and call the Clear method. The following example provides an illustration.
