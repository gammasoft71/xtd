  /// The following example demonstrates the xtd::date_time::days_in_month method and the xtd::month_of_year enumeration.
  /// @include date_time_days_in_month.cpp
  /// @remarks The xtd::month_of_year enumeration represents the month of the year in calendars that have twelve month per year. The value of the constants in this enumeration ranges from xtd::month_of_year::january to xtd::month_of_year::december. If cast to an integer, its value ranges from one (which indicates xtd::month_of_year::january) to twelve (which indicates xtd::month_of_year::december).
  /// @remarks This enumeration is useful when it is desirable to have a strongly typed specification of the day of the week. For example, this enumeration is the type of the property value for the xtd::date_time::day_of_week and xtd::date_time_offset::day_of_week properties.
  /// @remarks The members of the xtd::month_of_year enumeration are not localized. To return the localized name of the month of the year, call the xtd::date_time::to_string(string) method with either the "j" or "J" format strings. The former format string produces the abbreviated month name; the latter produces the full month name.
