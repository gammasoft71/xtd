  ///
  /// auto wr = web_request::create(contoso);
  /// ```
  /// The following code snippet shows example values of the various properties on the class.
  /// @include uri.cpp
  /// @remarks A URI is a compact representation of a resource available to your application on the intranet or Internet. The xtd::uri class defines the properties and methods for handling URIs, including parsing, comparing, and combining. The xtd::uri class properties are read-only; to create a modifiable object, use the xtd::uri_builder class.
  /// @remarks Relative URIs (for example, "/new/index.htm") must be expanded with respect to a base URI so that they are absolute. The xtd::uri::make_relative_uri method is provided to convert absolute URIs to relative URIs when necessary.
  /// @remarks The xtd::uri constructors do not escape URI strings if the string is a well-formed URI including a scheme identifier.
  /// @remarks The xtd::uri properties return a canonical data representation in escaped encoding, with all characters with Unicode values greater than 127 replaced with their hexadecimal equivalents. To put the URI in canonical form, the xtd::uri constructor performs the following steps:
  /// * Converts the URI scheme to lowercase.
  /// * Converts the host name to lowercase.
  /// * If the host name is an IPv6 address, the canonical IPv6 address is used. ScopeId and other optional IPv6 data are removed.
  /// * Removes default and empty port numbers.
  /// * Canonicalizes the path for hierarchical URIs by compacting sequences such as /./, /../, //, including escaped representations. Note that there are some schemes for which escaped representations are noy compacted.
  /// * For hierarchical URIs, if the host is not terminated with a forward slash (/), one is added.
  /// * By default, any reserved characters in the URI are escaped in accordance with RFC 2396. This behavior changes if International Resource Identifiers or International Domain Name parsing is enabled in which case reserved characters in the URI are escaped in accordance with RFC 3986 and RFC 3987.
  /// @remarks As part of canonicalization in the constructor for some schemes, escaped representations are compacted. The schemes for which URI will compact escaped sequences include the following: file, http, https, net.pipe, and net.tcp. For some other schemes, these sequences are not compacted. The following code snippet shows how compacting looks in practice. The escaped sequences are unescaped, if necessary, and then compacted.
  /// ```cpp
  /// auto uri = xtd::uri("http://myUrl/../.."); // http scheme, unescaped
  /// // OR
  /// auto uri = xtd::uri("http://myUrl/%2E%2E/%2E%2E"); // http scheme, escaped
  /// // OR
  /// var uri = xtd::uri("ftp://myUrl/../.."); // ftp scheme, unescaped
  /// // OR
  /// var uri = xtd:::uri("ftp://myUrl/%2E%2E/%2E%2E"); // ftp scheme, escaped
  ///
  /// console::write_line("Absolute uri: {}", uri.absolute_uri());
  /// console::write_line("Path And query: {}", uri.path_and_query());
  /// ```
  /// When this code executes, it returns output similar to the following text.
  /// ```cpp
  /// Absolute uri: http://myurl/
  /// Path And query: /
  /// ```
  /// @remarks You can transform the contents of the xtd::uri class from an escape encoded URI reference to a readable URI reference by using the xtd::uri::to_string method. Note that some reserved characters might still be escaped in the output of the xtd::uri::to_string method. This is to support unambiguous reconstruction of a URI from the value returned by xtd::uri::to_string.
  /// @remarks Some URIs include a fragment identifier or a query or both. A fragment identifier is any text that follows a number sign (#), not including the number sign; the fragment text is stored in the xtd::uri::fragment property. Query information is any text that follows a question mark (?) in the URI; the query text is stored in the xtd::uri::query property.
  /// @note The URI class supports the use of IP addresses in both quad-notation for IPv4 protocol and colon-hexadecimal for IPv6 protocol. Remember to enclose the IPv6 address in square brackets, as in http://[::1].
  /// @par International Resource Identifier Support
  /// Web addresses are typically expressed using uniform resource identifiers that consist of a very restricted set of characters:
  /// * Upper and lower case ASCII letters from the English alphabet.
  /// * Digits from 0 to 9.
  /// * A small number of other ASCII symbols.
  /// The specifications for URIs are documented in RFC 2396, RFC 2732, RFC 3986, and RFC 3987 published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
  /// <br><br>With the growth of the Internet, there is a growing need to identify resources using languages other than English. Identifiers which facilitate this need and allow non-ASCII characters (characters in the Unicode/ISO 10646 character set) are known as International Resource Identifiers (IRIs). The specifications for IRIs are documented in RFC 3987 published by IETF. Using IRIs allows a URL to contain Unicode characters.
  /// @par Implicit File Path Support
  /// xtd::uri can also be used to represent local file system paths. These paths can be represented explicitly in URIs that begin with the file:// scheme, and implicitly in URIs that do not have the file:// scheme. As a concrete example, the following two URIs are both valid, and represent the same file path:
  /// ```cpp
  /// auto uri1 = uri("C:/test/path/file.txt") // Implicit file path.
  /// auto uri2 = uri("file:///C:/test/path/file.txt") // Explicit file path.
  /// ```
  /// These implicit file paths are not compliant with the URI specification and so should be avoided when possible. When using Unix-based systems, implicit file paths can be especially problematic, because an absolute implicit file path is indistinguishable from a relative path. When such ambiguity is present, xtd::uri default to interpreting the path as an absolute URI.
  /// @par Security Considerations
  /// Because of security concerns, your application should use caution when accepting xtd::uri instances from untrusted sources and with dont_escape set to `true` in the constructor. You can check a URI string for validity by calling the xtd::uri::is_well_formed_original_string method.
  /// <br><br>When dealing with untrusted user input, confirm assumptions about the newly created xtd::uri instance before trusting its properties. This can be done in the following way:
  /// ```cpp
  /// string user_input = ...;
  ///
  /// auto base_uri = uri("https://myWebsite/files/");
  ///
  /// if (!uri::try_create(base_uri, user_input, new_uri)) {
  ///   // Fail: invalid input.
  /// }
  ///
  /// if (!base_uri.isbase_of(new_uri)) {
  ///   // Fail: the uri base has been modified - the created uri is not rooted in the original directory.
  /// }
  /// ```
  /// This validation can be used in other cases, like when dealing with UNC paths, by simply changing the base_uri:
  /// ```cpp
  /// aauto base_uri = uri(@"\\host\share\some\directory\name\");
  /// ```
