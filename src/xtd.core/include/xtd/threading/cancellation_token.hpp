  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// The following example uses a random number generator to emulate a data collection application that reads 10 integral values from eleven different instruments. A value of zero indicates that the measurement has failed for one instrument, in which case the operation should be cancelled and no overall mean should be computed.
    /// To handle the possible cancellation of the operation, the example instantiates a xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source object that generates a cancellation token that's passed to a xtd::threading::tasks::task_factory object. In turn, the xtd::threading::tasks::task_factory object passes the cancellation token to each of the tasks responsible for collecting readings for a particular instrument. The xtd::threading::tasks::task_factory::continue_when_all<antecedent_result_t,result_t>(std::vector<xtd::threading::tasks::task<antecedent_result_t>>, xtd::func<std::vector<xtd::threading::tasks::task<antecedent_tesult_t>>,TResult>, cancellation_token) method is called to ensure that the mean is computed only after all readings have been gathered successfully. If a task has not completed because it was cancelled, the xtd::threading::tasks::task_factory::continue_when_all method throws an exception.
    /// @include cancellation_token.cpp
    /// @remarks A xtd::threading::cancellation_token enables cooperative cancellation between threads, thread pool work items, or xtd::threading::taks::task objects. You create a cancellation token by instantiating a xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source object, which manages cancellation tokens retrieved from its xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::token property. You then pass the cancellation token to any number of threads, tasks, or operations that should receive notice of cancellation. The token cannot be used to initiate cancellation. When the owning object calls xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source.cancel, the xtd::threading::cancellation_token::is_cancellation_requested property on every copy of the cancellation token is set to true. The objects that receive the notification can respond in whatever manner is appropriate.
