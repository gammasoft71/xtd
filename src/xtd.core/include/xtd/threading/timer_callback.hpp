In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks Use a xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate to specify the method that is called by a xtd::threading::timer. This method does not execute in the thread that created the timer; it executes in a separate thread pool thread that is provided by the system. The xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate invokes the method once after the start time elapses, and continues to invoke it once per timer interval until the xtd::threading::timer is destroy, or until the xtd::threading::timer::change method is called with the interval value Infinite.
    /// @note The timer delegate is specified when the timer is constructed, and cannot be changed. The start time for a xtd::threading::timer is passed in the due_time parameter of the xtd::threading::timer constructors, and the period is passed in the period parameter. For an example that demonstrates creating and using a xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate, see xtd::threading::timer.
