  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.
  namespace threading {
    /// @brief Limits the number of threads that can access a resource or pool of resources concurrently.

    /// @ingroup xtd_core threading
    /// @remarks Use the xtd::threading::semaphore class to control access to a pool of resources. Threads enter the semaphore by calling the xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method, which is inherited from the xtd::threading::wait_handle class, and release the semaphore by calling the xtd::threading::semaphore::release method.
    /// @remarks The count on a semaphore is decremented each time a thread enters the semaphore, and incremented when a thread releases the semaphore. When the count is zero, subsequent requests block until other threads release the semaphore. When all threads have released the semaphore, the count is at the maximum value specified when the semaphore was created.
    /// @remarks There is no guaranteed order, such as FIFO or LIFO, in which blocked threads enter the semaphore.
    /// @remarks A thread can enter the semaphore multiple times, by calling the xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method repeatedly. To release some or all of these entries, the thread can call the parameterless xtd::threading::semaphore::release() method overload multiple times, or it can call the xtd::threading::semaphore::release(int32) method overload that specifies the number of entries to be released.
    /// @remarks The xtd::threading::semaphore class does not enforce thread identity on calls to xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one or xtd::threading::semaphore::release. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that threads do not release the semaphore too many times. For example, suppose a semaphore has a maximum count of two, and that thread A and thread B both enter the semaphore. If a programming error in thread B causes it to call xtd::threading::semaphore::release twice, both calls succeed. The count on the semaphore is full, and when thread A eventually calls xtd::threading::semaphore::release, a xtd::threading::semaphore_full_exception is thrown.
    /// @remarks Semaphores are of two types: local semaphores and named system semaphores. If you create a xtd::threading::semaphore object using a constructor that accepts a name, it is associated with an operating-system semaphore of that name. Named system semaphores are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create multiple xtd::threading::semaphore objects that represent the same named system semaphore, and you can use the xtd::threading::semaphore::open_existing method to open an existing named system semaphore.
    /// @remarks A local semaphore exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the local xtd::threading::semaphore object. Each xtd::threading::semaphore object is a separate local semaphore.
    /// @par Example
    /// The following code example creates a semaphore with a maximum count of three and an initial count of zero. The example starts five threads, which block waiting for the semaphore. The main thread uses the xtd::threading::semaphore::release(int32) method overload to increase the semaphore count to its maximum, allowing three threads to enter the semaphore. Each thread uses the xtd::threading::thread::sleep method to wait for one second, to simulate work, and then calls the xtd::threading::semaphore::release() method overload to release the semaphore. Each time the semaphore is released, the previous semaphore count is displayed. Console messages track semaphore use. The simulated work interval is increased slightly for each thread, to make the output easier to read.
