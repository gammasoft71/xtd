In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks The xtd uses a unified model for cooperative cancellation of asynchronous or long-running synchronous operations that involves two objects:
    /// * A xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source object, which provides a cancellation token through its xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::token property and sends a cancellation message by calling its xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::cancel or xtd::threading::cancellation_token_sourcecancel_after method.
    /// * A xtd::threading::cancellation_token object, which indicates whether cancellation is requested.
    /// @remarks The general pattern for implementing the cooperative cancellation model is:
    /// * Instantiate a xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source object, which manages and sends cancellation notification to the individual cancellation tokens.
    /// * Pass the token returned by the xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::token property to each task or thread that listens for cancellation.
    /// * Call the xtd::threading::cancellation_token::is_cancellation_requested method from operations that receive the cancellation token. Provide a mechanism for each task or thread to respond to a cancellation request. Whether you choose to cancel an operation, and exactly how you do it, depends on your application logic.
    /// * Call the xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::cancel method to provide notification of cancellation. This sets the xtd::threading::cancellation_token.is_cancellation_requested property on every copy of the cancellation token to `true`.
    /// * Call the xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source::close method when you are finished with the xtd::threading::cancellation_token_source object.
