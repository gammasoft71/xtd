  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// The following example uses the xtd::threading::lock_guard class to synchronize access to a single instance of a random number generator represented by the xtd::random class. The example creates ten threads, each of which executes asynchronously on a thread pool thread. Each thread generates 10,000 random numbers, calculates their average, and updates two procedure-level variables that maintain a running total of the number of random numbers generated and their sum. After all threads have executed, these two values are then used to calculate the overall mean.
