In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// The following example uses the xtd::threading::lock_guard class to synchronize access to a single instance of a random number generator represented by the xtd::random class. The example creates ten threads, each of which executes asynchronously on a thread pool thread. Each thread generates 10,000 random numbers, calculates their average, and updates two procedure-level variables that maintain a running total of the number of random numbers generated and their sum. After all threads have executed, these two values are then used to calculate the overall mean.

      /// @remarks The thread that currently owns the lock on the specified object invokes this method to signal the next thread in line for the lock. Upon receiving the pulse, the waiting thread is moved to the ready queue. When the thread that invoked xtd::threading::monitor::pulse releases the lock, the next thread in the ready queue (which is not necessarily the thread that was pulsed) acquires the lock.
      /// @warning The xtd::threading::monitor class does not maintain state indicating that the xtd::threading::monitor::pulse method has been called. Thus, if you call xtd::threading::monitor::pulse when no threads are waiting, the next thread that calls xtd::threading::monitor::wait blocks as if xtd::threading::monitor::pulse had never been called. If two threads are using xtd::threading::monitor::pulse and xtd::threading::monitor::wait to interact, this could result in a deadlock. Contrast this with the behavior of the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event class: If you signal an xtd::threading::auto_reset_event by calling its xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set method, and there are no threads waiting, the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event remains in a signaled state until a thread calls xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one, xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_any, or xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_all. The xtd::threading::auto_reset_event releases that thread and returns to the unsignaled state.

/// @remarks The lock_guard_ keyword ensures that one thread does not enter a critical section of code while another thread is in the critical section. If another thread tries to enter a locked code, it will wait, block, until the object is released.
/// @remarks The section Threading discusses threading.
/// @remarks The lock_guard_ keyword calls Enter at the start of the block and Exit at the end of the block. A xtd::threading::thread_interrupted_exception is thrown if xtd::threading::thread::interrupt interrupts a thread that is waiting to enter a lock statement.
/// @remarks In general, avoid locking on a public type, or instances beyond your code's control. The common constructs lock_guard_ (*this), lock_guard_ (typeof_<my_type>()), and lock_guard_ ("myLock") violate this guideline:
/// * lock_guard_ (*this) is a problem if the instance can be accessed publicly.
/// * lock_guard_ (typeof_<my_type>()) is a problem if my_type is publicly accessible.
/// * lock_guard_ ("my_lock") is a problem because any other code in the process using the same string, will share the same lock.
/// @remarks Best practice is to define a private object to lock on, or a private static object variable to protect data common to all instances.
/// @remarks You can't use the await_ keyword in the body of a lock_guard_ statement.
/// @par Examples
