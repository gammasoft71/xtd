  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks You use xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, xtd::threading::manual_reset_event, and xtd::threading::event_wait_handle for thread interaction (or thread signaling).
    /// @remarks A thread waits for a signal by calling xtd::threading::auto_reset_event::wWait_one. If the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event is in the non-signaled state, the thread blocks until xtd::threading::auto_reset_event::set is called.
    /// @remarks Calling xtd::threading::auto_reset_event::set signals xtd::threading::auto_reset_event to release a waiting thread. xtd::threading::auto_reset_event remains signaled until a single waiting thread is released, and then automatically returns to the non-signaled state. If no threads are waiting, the state remains signaled indefinitely.
    /// @remarks If a thread calls xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one while the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event is in the signaled state, the thread does not block. The xtd::threading::auto_reset_event releases the thread immediately and returns to the non-signaled state.
    /// @warning There is no guarantee that every call to the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event::set method will release a thread. If two calls are too close together, so that the second call occurs before a thread has been released, only one thread is released. It's as if the second call did not happen. Also, if xtd::threading::auto_reset_event::set is called when there are no threads waiting and the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event is already signaled, the call has no effect.
    /// @remarks You can xtd::threading::auto_reset_event the initial state of an xtd::threading::auto_reset_event by passing a bool value to the constructor: true if the initial state is signaled and false otherwise.
    /// @remarks AutoResetEvent can also be used with the static xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_all and xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_any methods.
    /// @note Unlike the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event class, the xtd::threading::event_wait_handle class provides access to named system synchronization events.
    /// @par Examples
    /// The following example shows how to use xtd::threading::auto_reset_event to release one thread at a time, by calling the xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set method (on the base class) each time the user presses the Enter key. The example starts three threads, which wait on an xtd::threading::auto_reset_event that was created in the signaled state. The first thread is released immediately, because the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event is already in the signaled state. This resets the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event to the non-signaled state, so that subsequent threads block. The blocked threads are not released until the user releases them one at a time by pressing the Enter key.
    /// After the threads are released from the first xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, they wait on another xtd::threading::auto_reset_event that was created in the non-signaled state. All three threads block, so the xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set method must be called three times to release them all.
