    /// @remarks When two or more threads need to access a shared resource at the same time, the system needs a synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread at a time uses the resource. xtd::threading::mutex is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one thread. If a thread acquires a mutex, the second thread that wants to acquire that mutex is suspended until the first thread releases the mutex.
    /// @remarks You can use the xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method to request ownership of a mutex. The calling thread blocks until one of the following occurs:
    /// * The mutex is signaled to indicate that it is not owned. When this happens, the xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method returns true, and the calling thread assumes ownership of the mutex and accesses the resource protected by the mutex. When it has finished accessing the resource, the thread must call the xtd::threading::mutex::release_mutex method to release ownership of the mutex. The first example in the Examples section illustrates this pattern.
    /// * The time-out interval specified in the call to a xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method that has a @verbatim milliseconds_timeout @endverbatim or timeout parameter has elapsed. When this happens, the xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method returns false, and the calling thread makes no further attempt to acquire ownership of the mutex. In this case, you should structure your code so that access to the resource that is protected by the mutex is denied to the calling thread. Because the thread never acquired ownership of the mutex, it must not call the xtd::threading::mutex::release_mutex method. The second example in the Examples section illustrates this pattern.
    /// @remarks The xtd::threading::mutex class enforces thread identity, so a mutex can be released only by the thread that acquired it. By contrast, the xtd::threading::semaphore class does not enforce thread identity. A mutex can also be passed across application domain boundaries.
    /// @remarks The thread that owns a mutex can request the same mutex in repeated calls to xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one without blocking its execution. However, the thread must call the xtd::threading::mutex::release_mutex method the same number of times to release ownership of the mutex.
    /// @remarks Because the xtd::threading::mutex class inherits from xtd::threading::wait_handle, you can also call the static xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_all and xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_any methods to synchronize access to a protected resource.
    /// @remarks If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned. The state of the mutex is set to signaled, and the next waiting thread gets ownership. An xtd::threading::abandoned_mutex_exception is thrown in the next thread that acquires the abandoned mutex.
    /// @warning An abandoned mutex often indicates a serious error in the code. When a thread exits without releasing the mutex, the data structures protected by the mutex might not be in a consistent state. The next thread to request ownership of the mutex can handle this exception and proceed, if the integrity of the data structures can be verified.
    /// @remarks In the case of a system-wide mutex, an abandoned mutex might indicate that an application has been terminated abruptly (for example, by using Windows Task Manager).
    /// @remarks Mutexes are of two types: local mutexes, which are unnamed, and named system mutexes. A local mutex exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the xtd::threading::mutex object that represents the mutex. Each unnamed xtd::threading::mutex object represents a separate local mutex.
    /// @remarks Named system mutexes are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes. You can create a xtd::threading::mutex object that represents a named system mutex by using a constructor that accepts a name. The operating-system object can be created at the same time, or it can exist before the creation of the xtd::threading::mutex object. You can create multiple xtd::threading::mutex objects that represent the same named system mutex, and you can use the xtd::threading::mutex::open_existing method to open an existing named system mutex.
    /// @warning The backslash (\) and slash(/) are a reserved character in a mutex name. Don't use a backslash (\) and slash (/) in a mutex name except as specified in the note on using mutexes in terminal server sessions. Otherwise, a xtd::io::directory_not_found_exception may be thrown, even though the name of the mutex represents an existing file.
    /// @remarks The unnamed mutex is a [std::recursive_timed_mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/recursive_timed_mutex) of C++17. You can therefore use xtd::threading::mutex or [std::recursive_timed_mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/recursive_timed_mutex) indifferently in your projects.
    /// @remarks If you use other synchronization objects for your threads and you use xtd::threading::thread you are interested in using xtd::threading::mutex. You will also benefit from xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_all and xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_any among others to synchronize all your objects.
    /// @remarks  On the other hand, if you only use mutexes and you use [std::thread](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread) then you are interested in using [std::recursive_timed_mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/recursive_timed_mutex).
    /// @par Examples
    /// This example shows how a local xtd::threading::mutex object is used to synchronize access to a protected resource. Because each calling thread is blocked until it acquires ownership of the mutex, it must call the xtd::threading::mutex::release_mutex method to release ownership of the mutex.
