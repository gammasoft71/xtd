  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// The following example shows how to use a xtd::threading::spin_lock:
    /// @include spin_lock.cpp
    /// @remarks Spin locks can be used for leaf-level locks where the object allocation implied by using a xtd::threading::monitor, in size, is overly expensive. A spin lock can be useful to avoid blocking; however, if you expect a significant amount of blocking, you should probably not use spin locks due to excessive spinning. Spinning can be beneficial when locks are fine-grained and large in number (for example, a lock per node in a linked list) and also when lock hold-times are always extremely short. In general, while holding a spin lock, one should avoid any of these actions:
    /// * blocking,
    /// * calling anything that itself may block,
    /// * holding more than one spin lock at once,
    /// * making dynamically dispatched calls (interface and virtuals),
    /// * making statically dispatched calls into any code one doesn't own, or
    /// * allocating memory.
    /// @remarks xtd::threading::spin_lock should only be used after you have been determined that doing so will improve an application's performance. It is also important to note that xtd::threading::spin_lock is a value type, for performance reasons. For this reason, you must be very careful not to accidentally copy a xtd::threading::spin_lock instance, as the two instances (the original and the copy) would then be completely independent of one another, which would likely lead to erroneous behavior of the application. If a xtd::threading::spin_lock instance must be passed around, it should be passed by reference rather than by value.
