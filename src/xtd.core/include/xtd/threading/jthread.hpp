  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::jthread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.
