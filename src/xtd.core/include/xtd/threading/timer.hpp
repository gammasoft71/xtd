/// @brief The xtd namespace contains all fundamental classes to access Hardware, Os, System, and more.
namespace xtd {
  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.
  namespace threading {
    /// @brief Provides a mechanism for executing a method on a thread pool thread at specified intervals. This class cannot be inherited.

    /// @ingroup xtd_core threading
    /// @par Examples
    /// The following example defines a status_checker class that includes a check_status method whose signature is the same as the xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate. The state argument of the check_status method is an xtd::threading::auto_reset_event object that is used to synchronize the application thread and the thread pool thread that executes the callback delegate. The status_checker class also includes two state variables:
    /// invoke_count
    /// Indicates the number of times the callback method has been invoked.
    /// max_count
    /// Determines the maximum number of times the callback method should be invoked.
    /// The application thread creates the timer, which waits one second and then executes the check_status callback method every 250 milliseconds. The application thread then blocks until the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event object is signaled. When the check_status callback method executes max_count times, it calls the auto_reset_event::set method to set the state of the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event object to signaled. The first time this happens, the application thread calls the xtd::threading::timer::change(int32, int32) method so that the callback method now executes every half second. It once again blocks until the xtd::threading::auto_reset_event object is signaled.
    /// @include timer.cpp
    /// @remarks Use a xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate to specify the method you want the xtd::threading::timer to execute. The signature of the xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate is: @verbatim using timer_callback = action<std::any> @endverbatim.
    /// @remarks The timer delegate is specified when the timer is constructed, and cannot be changed. The method does not execute on the thread that created the timer; it executes on axtd::threading::thread-pool thread supplied by the system.
    /// @note xtd includes several timer classes, each of which offers different functionality:
    /// * xtd::timers::timer, which fires an event and executes the code in one or more event sinks at regular intervals. The class is intended for use as a server-based or service component in a multithreaded environment; it has no user interface and is not visible at runtime.
    /// * xtd::threading::timer, which executes a single callback method on a thread pool thread at regular intervals. The callback method is defined when the timer is instantiated and cannot be changed. Like the xtd::timers::timer class, this class is intended for use as a server-based or service component in a multithreaded environment; it has no user interface and is not visible at runtime.
    /// * xtd::forms::timer, a Windows Forms component that fires an event and executes the code in one or more event sinks at regular intervals. The component has no user interface and is designed for use in a single-threaded environment; it executes on the UI thread.
    /// @remarks When you create a timer, you can specify an amount of time to wait before the first execution of the method (due time), and an amount of time to wait between subsequent executions (period). The xtd::threading::timer class has the same resolution as the system clock. This means that if the period is less than the resolution of the system clock, the xtd::threading::timer_callback delegate will execute at intervals defined by the resolution of the system clock, which is approximately 15 milliseconds on Windows 7 and Windows 8 systems. You can change the due time and period, or disable the timer, by using the xtd::forms::timer::change method.
    /// @note As long as you are using a xtd::threading::timer, you must keep a reference to it. As with any managed object, a xtd::threading::timer is subject to garbage collection when there are no references to it. The fact that a xtd::threading::timer is still active does not prevent it from being collecte
    /// @note The system clock that is used is the same clock used by GetTickCount, which is not affected by changes made with timeBeginPeriod and timeEndPeriod.
    /// @remarks The callback method executed by the timer should be reentrant, because it is called onxtd::threading::thread-pool threads. The callback can be executed simultaneously on two thread pool threads if the timer interval is less than the time required to execute the callback, or if all thread pool threads are in use and the callback is queued multiple times.
    /// @note xtd::threading::timer is a simple, lightweight timer that uses callback methods and is served by thread pool threads. It is not recommended for use with Windows Forms, because its callbacks do not occur on the user interface thread. xtd::forms::timer is a better choice for use with Windows Forms. For server-based timer functionality, you might consider using xtd::timers::timer, which raises events and has additional features.
