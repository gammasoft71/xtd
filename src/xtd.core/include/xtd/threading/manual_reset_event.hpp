  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @brief Represents a thread synchronization event that, when signaled, must be reset manually. This class cannot be inherited.

    /// @remarks You use xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, xtd::threading::manual_reset_event, and xtd::threading::event_wait_handle for thread interaction (or thread signaling).
    /// @remarks When a thread begins an activity that must complete before other threads proceed, it calls xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::reset to put xtd::threading::manual_reset_event in the non-signaled state. This thread can be thought of as controlling the xtd::threading::manual_reset_event. Threads that call xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one block, awaiting the signal. When the controlling thread completes the activity, it calls xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set to signal that the waiting threads can proceed. All waiting threads are released.
    /// @remarks Once it has been signaled, xtd::threading::manual_reset_event remains signaled until it is manually reset by calling the xtd::threading::event_wait_handle::reset() method. That is, calls to xtd::threading::wait_handle:wait_one return immediately.
    /// @remarks You can control the initial state of a xtd::threading::manual_reset_event by passing a bool value to the constructor: `true` if the initial state is signaled, and `false` otherwise.
    /// @remarks xtd::threading::manual_reset_event can also be used with the static xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_all and xtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_any methods.
    /// @warning Unlike the xtd::threading::manual_reset_event class, the xtd::threading::event_wait_handle class provides access to named system synchronization events.
    /// @par example
    /// The following example demonstrates how xtd::threading::manual_reset_event works. The example starts with a xtd::threading::manual_reset_event in the unsignaled state (that is, `false` is passed to the constructor). The example creates three threads, each of which blocks on the xtd::threading::manual_reset_event by calling its wtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method. When the user presses the Enter key, the example calls the wtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set method, which releases all three threads. Contrast this with the behavior of the wtd::threading::auto_reset_event class, which releases threads one at a time, resetting automatically after each release.<br>
    /// Pressing the Enter key again demonstrates that the xtd::threading::manual_reset_event remains in the signaled state until its wtd::threading::event_wait_handle::reset method is called: The example starts two more threads. These threads do not block when they call the wtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one method, but instead run to completion.<br>
    /// Pressing the Enter key again causes the example to call the wtd::threading::event_wait_handle::reset method and to start one more thread, which blocks when it calls wtd::threading::wait_handle::wait_one. Pressing the Enter key one final time calls wtd::threading::event_wait_handle::set to release the last thread, and the program ends.
