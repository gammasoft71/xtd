  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks The methods of this class help protect against errors that can occur when the scheduler switches contexts while a thread is updating a variable that can be accessed by other threads, or when two threads are executing concurrently on separate processors. The members of this class do not throw exceptions.
    /// @remarks The xtd::threading::interlocked::increment and xtd::threading::interlocked::decrement methods increment or decrement a variable and store the resulting value in a single operation. On most computers, incrementing a variable is not an atomic operation, requiring the following steps:
    /// @remarks   1. Load a value from an instance variable into a register.
    /// @remarks   2. Increment or decrement the value.
    /// @remarks   3. Store the value in the instance variable.
    /// @remarks If you do not use xtd::threading::interlocked::increment and xtd::threading::interlocked::decrement, a thread can be preempted after executing the first two steps. Another thread can then execute all three steps. When the first thread resumes execution, it overwrites the value in the instance variable, and the effect of the increment or decrement performed by the second thread is lost.
    /// @remarks The xtd::threading::exchange method atomically exchanges the values of the specified variables. The compare_exchange method combines two operations: comparing two values and storing a third value in one of the variables, based on the outcome of the comparison. The compare and exchange operations are performed as an atomic operation.
