  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.
  namespace threading {
    /// @brief Provides a pool of threads that can be used to execute tasks, post work items, process asynchronous I/O, wait on behalf of other threads, and process timers.

    /// @ingroup xtd_core threading
    /// @par Examples
    /// In the following example, the main application thread queues a method named ThreadProc to execute on a thread pool thread, sleeps for one second, and then exits. The ThreadProc method simply displays a message.
    /// @include thread_pool.cpp
    /// If you comment out the call to the xtd::threading::thread::sleep method, the main thread exits before method runs on the thread pool thread. The thread pool uses background threads, which do not keep the application running if all foreground threads have terminated. (This is a simple example of a race condition.)
    /// @remarks Many applications create threads that spend a great deal of time in the sleeping state, waiting for an event to occur. Other threads might enter a sleeping state only to be awakened periodically to poll for a change or update status information. The thread pool enables you to use threads more efficiently by providing your application with a pool of worker threads that are managed by the system. Examples of operations that use thread pool threads include the following:
    /// * When you create a xtd::threading::task::task or xtd::threading::task::task < result_t > object to perform some task asynchronously, by default the task is scheduled to run on a thread pool thread.
    /// * Asynchronous timers use the thread pool. Thread pool threads execute callbacks from the xtd::threading::timer class and raise events from the xtd::timers::timer class.
    /// * When you use registered wait handles, a system thread monitors the status of the wait handles. When a wait operation completes, a worker thread from the thread pool executes the corresponding callback function.
    /// * When you call the xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item method to queue a method for execution on a thread pool thread. You do this by passing the method a xtd::threading::wait_callback delegate. The delegate has the signature @verbatom using wait_callback = action<std::any> @endverbatim where state is an object that contains data to be used by the delegate. The actual data can be passed to the delegate by calling the xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item(xtd::threading::wait_callback, std::any) method.
    /// @note The threads in the managed thread pool are background threads. That is, their xtd::threading::thread::is_background properties are true. This means that a xtd::threading::thread_pool thread will not keep an application running after all foreground threads have exited.
    /// @remarks You can also queue work items that are not related to a wait operation to the thread pool. To request that a work item be handled by a thread in the thread pool, call the xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item method. This method takes as a parameter a reference to the method or delegate that will be called by the thread selected from the thread pool. There is no way to cancel a work item after it has been queued.
    /// @remarks Timer-queue timers and registered wait operations also use the thread pool. Their callback functions are queued to the thread pool.
    /// @remarks There is one thread pool per process.The default size of the thread pool for a process depends on several factors, such as the size of the virtual address space. A process can call the xtd::threading::thread_pool::gt_max_threads method to determine the number of threads. The number of threads in the thread pool can be changed by using the xtd::threading::thread_pool::set_max_threads method. Each thread uses the default stack size and runs at the default priority.
    /// @remarks The thread pool provides new worker threads or I/O completion threads on demand until it reaches the maximum for each category. When a maximum is reached, the thread pool can create additional threads in that category or wait until some tasks complete. The thread pool creates and destroys worker threads in order to optimize throughput, which is defined as the number of tasks that complete per unit of time. Too few threads might not make optimal use of available resources, whereas too many threads could increase resource contention.
    /// @note When demand is low, the actual number of thread pool threads can fall below the minimum values.
    /// @remarks You can use the xtd::threading::thread_pool::get_min_threads method to obtain these minimum values.
    /// @warning You can use the xtd::threading::thread_pool::set_min_threads method to increase the minimum number of threads. However, unnecessarily increasing these values can cause performance problems. If too many tasks start at the same time, all of them might appear to be slow. In most cases the thread pool will perform better with its own algorithm for allocating threads.
