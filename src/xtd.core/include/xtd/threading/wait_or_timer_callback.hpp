  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks xtd::threading::wait_or_timer_callback represents a callback method that you want to execute when a registered wait handle times out or is signaled. Create the delegate by passing your callback method to the xtd::threading::wait_or_timer_callback constructor. Your method must have the signature shown here.
    /// @remarks Create the registered wait handle by passing the xtd::threading::wait_or_timer_callback delegate and a xtd::threading::wait_handle to xtd::threading::thread_pool::register_wait_for_single_object. Your callback method executes each time the xtd::threading::wait_handle times out or is signaled.
    /// @remarks If you want to pass information to your callback method, create an object that contains the necessary information and pass it to xtd::threading::thread_pool::register_wait_for_single_object when you create the registered wait handle. Each time your callback method executes, the state parameter contains this object.
