  /// @brief The xtd::threading namespace provides classes and interfaces that enable multithreaded programming. In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( xtd::threading::mutex, xtd::threading::monitor, xtd::threading::interlocked, xtd::threading::auto_reset_event, and so on), this namespace includes a xtd::threading::thread_pool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a xtd::threading::timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

    /// @remarks xtd::threading::wait_callback represents a callback method that you want to execute on a xtd::threading::thread_pool thread. Create the delegate by passing your callback method to the xtd::threading::wait_callback constructor. Your method must have the signature shown here.
    /// @remarks Queue the method for execution by passing the xtd::threading::wait_callback delegate to xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item. The callback method executes when a thread pool thread becomes available.
    /// @remarks If you want to pass information to the callback method, create an object that contains the necessary information and pass it to the xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item(xtd::threading::wait_callback, xtd::object&) method as the second argument. Each time the callback method executes, the state parameter contains this object.
    /// @remarks For examples that use the xtd::threading::wait_callback delegate, see the xtd::threading::thread_pool::queue_user_work_item method.
