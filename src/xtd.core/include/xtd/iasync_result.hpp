  /// @remarks The xtd::iasync_result interface is implemented by classes containing methods that can operate asynchronously. It is the return type of methods that initiate an asynchronous operation, such as xtd::io::file_stream.begin_read, and it is passed to methods that conclude an asynchronous operation, such as xtd::io::file_stream::end_read. xtd::iasync_result objects are also passed to methods invoked by xtd::async_callback delegates when an asynchronous operation completes.
  /// @remarks An object that supports the xtd::iasync_result interface stores state information for an asynchronous operation and provides a synchronization object to allow threads to be signaled when the operation completes.
  /// @note The async_result class is the implementation of xtd::iasync_result that is returned by the begin_invoke method when you use a delegate to call a method asynchronously.
  /// @par Examples
  /// The following example shows how to use xtd::iasync_result interface.

    /// @remarks The return value allows the client to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete instead of polling xtd::iasync_result::is_completed until the operation concludes. The return value can be used to perform a wait operation.
    /// @par Notes to Implementers
    /// The object that implements xtd::iasync_result does not need to create the xtd::threading::wait_handle until the xtd::iasync_result::async_wait_handle property is read. It is the choice of the xtd::iasync_result implementer. However, if the implementer creates xtd::iasync_result::async_wait_handle, it is the responsibility of the implementer to signal the xtd::threading::wait_handle that will terminate the wait at the appropriate time. Once created, xtd::iasync_result xtd::iasync_result::async_wait_handle should be kept alive until the user calls the method that concludes the asynchronous operation. At that time the object behind xtd::iasync_result::async_wait_handle can be discarded.
