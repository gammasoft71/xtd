The custom object is an instance of the type Box, and the collection class is BoxCollection. This code example is part of a larger example provided for the ICollection<T> interface.

      /// @remarks xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator <type_t> is the base interface for all generic enumerators.
      /// @remarks The for each statement of the C++ language hides the complexity of the enumerators. Therefore, using `for` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.
      /// @remarks Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.
      /// @remarks Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. At this position, xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current is undefined. Therefore, you must call xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current.
      /// @remarks xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current returns the same object until xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next is called. xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next sets xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current to the next element.
      /// @remarks If xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next returns false. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next also return false. If the last call to xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::move_next returned false, xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current is undefined. You cannot set xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::current to the first element of the collection again; you must create a new enumerator instance instead.
      /// @remarks The xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::reset method is provided for COM interoperability. It does not necessarily need to be implemented; instead, the implementer can simply throw a NotSupportedException. However, if you choose to do this, you should make sure no callers are relying on the xtd::collections::generic::ienumerator::reset functionality.
      /// @remarks If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the behavior of the enumerator is undefined.
      /// @remarks The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread-safe procedure. To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can lock the collection during the entire enumeration. To allow the collection to be accessed by multiple threads for reading and writing, you must implement your own synchronization.
