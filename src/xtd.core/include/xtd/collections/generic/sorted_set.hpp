      /// @remarks The xtd::collections::generic::sorted_set class is same as [std::set](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/set).
      /// @remarks A xtd::collections::generic::sorted_set object maintains a sorted order without affecting performance as elements are inserted and deleted. Duplicate elements are ! allowed. Changing the sort values of existing items is ! supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
      /// @par Examples
      /// The following example demonstrates how to merge two disparate sets. This example creates two xtd::collections::generic::sorted_set objects, and populates them with even and odd numbers, respectively. A third xtd::collections::generic::sorted_set object is created from the set that contains the even numbers. The example then calls the UnionWith method, which adds the odd number set to the third set.
