    /// @remarks A xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch instance can measure elapsed time for one interval, or the total of elapsed time across multiple intervals. In a typical xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch scenario, you call the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::start method, then eventually call the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::stop method, and then you check elapsed time using the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::elapsed property.
    /// @remarks A xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch instance is either running or stopped; use xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::is_running to determine the current state of a xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::. Use xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::start to begin measuring elapsed time; use xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::stop to stop measuring elapsed time. Query the elapsed time value through the properties xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::elapsed, xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::elapsed_milliseconds, or xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::elapsed_ticks. You can query the elapsed time properties while the instance is running or stopped. The elapsed time properties steadily increase while the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch is running; they remain constant when the instance is stopped.
    /// @remarks By default, the elapsed time value of a xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch:: instance equals the total of all measured time intervals. Each call to xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::start begins counting at the cumulative elapsed time; each call to xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::stop ends the current interval measurement and freezes the cumulative elapsed time value. Use the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::reset method to clear the cumulative elapsed time in an existing xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch instance.
    /// @remarks The xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch measures elapsed time by counting timer ticks in the underlying timer mechanism. If the installed hardware and operating system support a high-resolution performance counter, then the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch:: class uses that counter to measure elapsed time. Otherwise, the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch class uses the system timer to measure elapsed time. Use the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::frequency and xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::is_high_resolution fields to determine the precision and resolution of the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch timing implementation.
    /// @remarks The xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch class assists the manipulation of timing-related performance counters. Specifically, the xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::frequency field and xtd::diagnostics::stopwatch::get_timestamp method can be used in place of the Win32 APIs QueryPerformanceFrequency and QueryPerformanceCounter.
