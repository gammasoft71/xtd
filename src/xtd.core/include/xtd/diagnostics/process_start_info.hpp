    /// @remarks xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info is used together with the xtd::diagnostics::process component. When you start a process using the xtd::diagnostics::process class, you have access to process information in addition to that available when attaching to a running process.
    /// @remarks You can use the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info class for better control over the process you start. You must at least set the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::file_name property, either manually or using the constructor. The file name is any application or document. Here a document is defined to be any file type that has an open or default action associated with it. You can view registered file types and their associated applications for your computer by using the Folder Options dialog box, which is available through the operating system. The Advanced button leads to a dialog box that shows whether there is an open action associated with a specific registered file type.
    /// @remarks In addition, you can set other properties that define actions to take with that file. You can specify a value specific to the type of the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::file_name property for the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::verb property. For example, you can specify "print" for a document type. Additionally, you can specify xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::arguments property values to be command-line arguments to pass to the file's open procedure. For example, if you specify a text editor application in the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::file_name property, you can use the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::arguments property to specify a text file to be opened by the editor.
    /// @remarks Standard input is usually the keyboard, and standard output and standard error are usually the monitor screen. However, you can use the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::redirect_standard_input, xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::redirect_standard_output, and xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info::redirect_standard_error properties to cause the process to get input from or return output to a file or other device. If you use the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_input, xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output, or xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_error properties on the xtd::diagnostics::process component, you must first set the corresponding value on the xtd::diagnostics::process_start_info property. Otherwise, the system throws an exception when you read or write to the stream.

These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.

Methods such as xtd::io::stream_reader::read, xtd::io::stream_reader::read_line, and xtd::io::stream_reader::read_to_end perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated xtd::diagnostics::process writes to its xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_error stream, or closes the stream.

      /// @remarks Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_error stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.

For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.

Otherwise, reading from the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream throws an exception.
      /// @remarks The redirected xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as xtd::io::stream_reader::read, xtd::io::stream_reader::read_line, and xtd::io::stream_reader::read_to_end perform synchronous read operations on the output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated Process writes to its xtd::diagnostics::process::xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream, or closes the stream.
      /// @remarks In contrast, xtd::diagnostics::process::begin_output_read_line starts asynchronous read operations on the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.
      /// @remarks Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.
