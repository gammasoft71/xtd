    /// @remarks This class is the base class for the boolean_switch, source_switch and the trace_switch classes. These switches meet most debugging and tracing needs.
    /// @par Notes to implementers
    /// If you need trace levels, or mechanisms for setting switch levels different from those provided by boolean_switch, source_switch and trace_switch, you can inherit from switch_base. When inheriting from this class, you must implement the switch_setting method.
