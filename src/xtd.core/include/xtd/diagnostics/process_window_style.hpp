Frequently, an application may initialize a new window to the Hidden style while it customizes the window's appearance, and then make the window style Normal.

A hidden window can process messages from the system or from other windows, but it cannot process input from the user or display output. Frequently, an application may keep a new window hidden while it customizes the window's appearance, and then make the window style Normal. To use process_window_style.Hidden, the ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute property must be false.

If the window has a title bar, the system automatically moves it to the top of the screen or to the top of the parent window's client area. Also, the system disables the window's sizing border and the window-positioning capability of the title bar so that the user cannot move the window by dragging the title bar.
