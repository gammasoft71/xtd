  /// @brief The xtd::source_location class represents certain information about the source code, such as file names, line numbers, and function names. Previously, functions that desire to obtain this information about the call site (for logging, testing, or debugging purposes) must use macros so that [predefined macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/replace#Predefined_macros) like `__LINE__` and `__FILE__` are expanded in the context of the caller. The xtd::source_location class provides a better alternative.
