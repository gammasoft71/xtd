    /// @include process.cpp
    /// @remarks A xtd::diagnostics::process component provides access to a process that is running on a computer. A process, in the simplest terms, is a running app. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the code of the process, including parts currently being executed by another thread.
    /// @remarks The xtd::diagnostics::process component is a useful tool for starting, stopping, controlling, and monitoring apps. You can use the xtd::diagnostics::process component, to obtain a list of the processes that are running, or you can start a new process. A Process component is used to access system processes. After a xtd::diagnostics::process component has been initialized, it can be used to obtain information about the running process. Such information includes the set of threads, the loaded modules (.dll and .exe files), and performance information such as the amount of memory the process is using.
    /// @note 32-bit processes cannot access the modules of a 64-bit process. If you try to get information about a 64-bit process from a 32-bit process, you will get a Win32Exception exception. A 64-bit process, on the other hand, can access the modules of a 32-bit process.
    /// @remarks The xtd::diagnostics::process component obtains information about a group of properties all at once. After the xtd::diagnostics::process component has obtained information about one member of any group, it will cache the values for the other properties in that group and not obtain new information about the other members of the group until you call the xtd::diagnostics::process::refresh method. Therefore, a property value is not guaranteed to be any newer than the last call to the xtd::diagnostics::process::refresh method. The group breakdowns are operating-system dependent.
    /// @remarks If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if c:\mypath is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: path = %path%;"c:\mypath", you must fully qualify any process in c:\mypath when starting it.
    /// @remarks A system process is uniquely identified on the system by its process identifier. Like many Windows resources, a process is also identified by its handle, which might not be unique on the computer. A handle is the generic term for an identifier of a resource. The operating system persists the process handle, which is accessed through the Handle property of the Process component, even when the process has exited. Thus, you can get the process's administrative information, such as the xtd::diagnostics::process::exit_code (usually either zero for success or a nonzero error code) and the xtd::diagnostics::process::exit_time. xtd::diagnostics::process::handles are an extremely valuable resource, so leaking handles is more virulent than leaking memory.

Methods such as xtd::io::stream_reader::read, xtd::io::stream_reader::read_line, and xtd::io::stream_reader::read_to_end perform synchronous read operations on the output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated Process writes to its xtd::diagnostics::process::xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream, or closes the stream.
      /// @remarks In contrast, xtd::diagnostics::process::begin_output_read_line starts asynchronous read operations on the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.
      /// @remarks Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the xtd::diagnostics::process::standard_output stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.

When a process with a graphical interface is executing, its message loop is in a wait state. The message loop executes every time a Windows message is sent to the process by the operating system. Calling xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window sends a request to close the main window, which, in a well-formed application, closes child windows and revokes all running message loops for the application. The request to exit the process by calling xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window does not force the application to quit. The application can ask for user verification before quitting, or it can refuse to quit. To force the application to quit, use the xtd::diagnostics::process::kill method.
      /// @remarks The behavior of xtd::diagnostics::process::xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window is identical to that of a user closing an application's main window using the system menu. Therefore, the request to exit the process by closing the main window does not force the application to quit immediately.
      /// @note The xtd::diagnostics::process::kill method executes asynchronously. After calling the xtd::diagnostics::process::kill method, call the xtd::diagnostics::process::xtd::diagnostics::process::wait_for_exit method to wait for the process to exit, or check the xtd::diagnostics::process::has_exited property to determine if the process has exited.
      /// @note The xtd::diagnostics::process::wait_for_exit method and the xtd::diagnostics::process::has_exited property do not reflect the status of descendant processes. When xtd::diagnostics::process::kill(entireProcessTree: true) is used, xtd::diagnostics::process::wait_for_exit and xtd::diagnostics::process::has_exited will indicate that exiting has completed after the given process exits, even if all descendants have not yet exited.
      /// @remarks Data edited by the process or resources allocated to the process can be lost if you call xtd::diagnostics::process::kill. xtd::diagnostics::process::kill causes an abnormal process termination and should be used only when necessary. xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window enables an orderly termination of the process and closes all windows, so it is preferable for applications with an interface. If xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window fails, you can use xtd::diagnostics::process::kill to terminate the process. xtd::diagnostics::process::kill is the only way to terminate processes that do not have graphical interfaces.
      /// @remarks You can call xtd::diagnostics::process::kill and xtd::diagnostics::process::close_main_window only for processes that are running on the local computer. You cannot cause processes on remote computers to exit. You can only view information for processes running on remote computers.
