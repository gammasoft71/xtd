    /// @remarks Use the xtd::io::directory class for typical operations such as copying, moving, renaming, creating, and deleting directories.
    /// * To create a directory, use one of the xtd::io::directory::create_directory methods.
    /// * To delete a directory, use one of the xtd::io::directory::remove methods.
    /// * To get or set the current directory for an app, use the xtd::io::directory::get_current_directory or xtd::io::directory::set_current_directory method.
    /// * To manipulate date/time information related to the creation, access, and writing of a directory, use methods such as xtd::io::directory::set_last_access_time and xtd::io::directory::set_creation_time.
    /// @remarks The static methods of the xtd::io::directory class perform security checks on all methods. If you are going to reuse an object several times, consider using the corresponding instance method of xtd::io::directory_info instead, because the security check will not always be necessary.
    /// @remarks If you are performing only one directory-related action, it might be more efficient to use a static xtd::io::directory method rather than a corresponding xtd::io::directory_info instance method. Most xtd::io::directory methods require the path to the directory that you are manipulating.
    /// @note In members that accept a string path parameter, that path must be well-formed or an exception is raised. For example, if a path is fully qualified but begins with a space (" c:\temp"), the path string isn't trimmed, so the path is considered malformed and an exception is raised. In addition, a path or a combination of paths cannot be fully qualified twice. For example, "c:\temp c:\windows" also raises an exception. Ensure that your paths are well-formed when using methods that accept a path string. For more information see xtd::io::path.
    /// @remarks In members that accept a path, the path can refer to a file or a directory. You can use a full path, a relative path, or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for a server and share name. For example, all the following are acceptable paths:
    /// * "c:\\MyDir".
    /// * "MyDir\\MySubdir".
    /// * "\\\\MyServer\\MyShare".
    /// @remarks By default, full read/write access to new directories is granted to all users. However, the app must have the correct security to access existing directories.
    /// @remarks To demand permissions for a directory and all its subdirectories, end the path string with the directory separator character. (For example, "C:\Temp\" grants access to C:\Temp\ and all its subdirectories.) To demand permissions only for a specific directory, end the path string with a period. (For example, "C:\Temp\." grants access only to C:\Temp\, not to its subdirectories.)
    /// @remarks In members that accept a search_pattern parameter, the search string can be any combination of literal characters and two wildcard characters; * and ?. This parameter does not recognize regular expressions. For more information, see the xtd::io::directory::enumerate_directories(string, string) method or any other method that uses the search_pattern parameter.
    /// @remarks For a list of common I/O tasks, see [Common I/O Tasks](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/docs/documentation/Guides/xtd.core/Common%20I%3AO%20tasks).

      /// @remarks Characters other than the wildcard are literal characters. For example, the search_pattern string "*t" searches for all names in path ending with the letter "t". The search_pattern string "s*" searches for all names in path beginning with the letter "s".
      /// @remarks search_pattern cannot end in two periods ("..") or contain two periods ("..") followed by xtd::io::path::directory_separator_char or xtd::io::path::alt_directory_separator_char, nor can it contain any invalid characters. You can query for invalid characters by using the xtd::io::path::get_invalid_path_chars method.
      /// @note When you use the asterisk wildcard character in a search_pattern such as "*.txt", the number of characters in the specified extension affects the search as follows:
      /// * If the specified extension is exactly three characters long, the method returns files with extensions that begin with the specified extension. For example, "*.xls" returns both "book.xls" and "book.xlsx".
      /// * In all other cases, the method returns files that exactly match the specified extension. For example, "*.ai" returns "file.ai" but not "file.aif".
      /// <br>When you use the question mark wildcard character, this method returns only files that match the specified file extension. For example, given two files, "file1.txt" and "file1.txtother", in a directory, a search pattern of "file?.txt" returns just the first file, whereas a search pattern of "file*.txt" returns both files.
      /// @note Because this method checks against file names with both the 8.3 file name format and the long file name format, a search pattern similar to "*1*.txt" may return unexpected file names. For example, using a search pattern of "*1*.txt" returns "longfilename.txt" because the equivalent 8.3 file name format is "LONGFI~1.TXT".
      /// @remarks The xtd::io::directory::enumerate_files and xtd::io::directory::get_files methods differ as follows: When you use xtd::io::directory::enumerate_files, you can start enumerating the collection of names before the whole collection is returned; when you use xtd::io::directory::get_files, you must wait for the whole array of names to be returned before you can access the array.
