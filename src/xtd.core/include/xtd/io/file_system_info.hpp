    /// @remarks The xtd::io::file_system_info class contains methods that are common to file and directory manipulation. A xtd::io::file_system_info object can represent either a file or a directory, thus serving as the basis for xtd::io::file_info or xtd::io::directory_info objects. Use this base class when parsing a lot of files and directories.
    /// @remarks In members that accept a path, the path can refer to a file or just a directory. The specified path can also refer to a relative path or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for a server and share name. For example, all the following are acceptable paths:
    /// * "c:\\MyDir\\MyFile.txt"
