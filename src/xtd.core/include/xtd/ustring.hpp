  /// @remarks A string is a sequential collection of characters that's used to represent text. A xtd::ustring object is a sequential collection of char that represent a string; a char corresponds to a UTF-8 code unit. The value of the xtd::ustring object is the content of the sequential collection of char, and unlike [std::basic_string<char>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) that value is immutable (that is, it is read-only).
  /// @remarks If you want the same mutable string class, you can use xtd::text::ustring_builder class.
  /// @remarks xtd::ustring is inherited from [std::basic_string<char>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) and therefore offers the full (immutable) API of std::string.
  /// @remarks xtd::ustring cannot inherit from xtd::iequatable <xtd::ustring> because [std::basic_string<char>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) defines the [== and != operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/operator_cmp).
