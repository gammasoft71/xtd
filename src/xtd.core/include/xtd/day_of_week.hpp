  /// The following example demonstrates the xtd::date_time::day_of_week property and the xtd::day_of_week enumeration.
  /// @include date_time_day_of_week.cpp
  /// @remarks The xtd::day_of_week enumeration represents the day of the week in calendars that have seven days per week. The value of the constants in this enumeration ranges from xtd::day_of_week::sunday to xtd::day_of_week::saturday. If cast to an integer, its value ranges from zero (which indicates xtd::day_of_week::sunday) to six (which indicates xtd::day_of_week::saturday).
  /// @remarks This enumeration is useful when it is desirable to have a strongly typed specification of the day of the week. For example, this enumeration is the type of the property value for the xtd::date_time::day_of_week and xtd::date_time_offset::day_of_week properties.
  /// @remarks The members of the xtd::day_of_week enumeration are not localized. To return the localized name of the day of the week, call the xtd::date_time::to_string(string) method with either the "h" or "H" format strings. The former format string produces the abbreviated weekday name; the latter produces the full weekday name.
