    /// @remarks The xtd::forms::link_label::link class defines the properties of a link within a xtd::forms::link_label control. You can use these properties to provide data to the xtd::forms::link_label::link_clicked event of the xtd::forms::link_label control to perform tasks when the link is clicked in the control. The xtd::forms::link_label::link_data property enables you to define information that the xtd::forms::link_label::link_clicked event can use to display a URL within your web browser or to open a file.
    /// @remarks In addition to information related to the link, the properties of the xtd::forms::link_label::link class also help define the text of the xtd::forms::link_label::lLink and its display state. The xtd::forms::link_label::start and xtd::forms::link_label::length properties define the location and length of text from the text of the xtd::forms::link_label control to display as a link. The xtd::forms::link_label::enabled property allows you to display the link as a disabled link, and the xtd::forms::link_label::visited property can alert the user that they already visited the specified link in the current instance of the xtd::forms::link_label.
    /// @remarks You can display multiple links in a single xtd::forms::link_label control. Each xtd::forms::link_label::link is added into the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection associated with the xtd::forms::link_label control. To obtain the collection of links defined in a xtd::forms::link_label control, use the xtd::forms::link_label::links property.
