    /// @ingroup xtd_forms controls
    /// @remarks To create your own control class, inherit from the xtd::forms::user_control, xtd::forms::control classes, or from the other Windows Forms provided controls.
    /// @remarks The xtd::forms::control class implements very basic functionality required by classes that display information to the user. It handles user input through the keyboard and pointing devices. It handles message routing and security. It defines the bounds of a control (its position and size), although it does not implement painting. It provides a window handle (hWnd).
    /// @remarks Windows Forms controls use ambient properties so child controls can appear like their surrounding environment. An ambient property is a control property that, if not set, is retrieved from the xtd::forms::control::parent control. If the control does not have a parent, and the property is not set, the control attempts to determine the value of the ambient property through the site property. If the control is not sited, if the site does not support ambient properties, or if the property is not set on the ambient_properties, the control uses its own default values. Typically, an ambient property represents a characteristic of a control, such as xtd::forms::control::back_color, that is communicated to a child control. For example, a button will have the same xtd::forms::control::back_color as its parent form by default. Ambient properties provided by the control class include: xtd::forms::control::cursor, xtd::forms::control::font, xtd::forms::control::back_color, xtd::forms::control::fore_color, and xtd::forms::control::right_to_left.
    /// @remarks The majority of the controls in the xtd::forms namespace use the underlying Windows common control as a base to build on.

      /// @brief Occurs when the xtd::forms::control is clicked.
      /// @remarks The xtd::forms::control::click event passes an xtd::event_args to its event handler, so it only indicates that a click has occurred. If you need more specific mouse information (button, number of clicks, wheel rotation, or location), use the xtd::forms::control::mouse_click event. However, the xtd::forms::control::mouse_click event will not be raised if the click is caused by action other than that of the mouse, such as pressing the ENTER key.
      /// @remarks A double-click is determined by the mouse settings of the user's operating system. The user can set the time between clicks of a mouse button that should be considered a double-click rather than two clicks. The xtd::forms::control::click event is raised every time a control is double-clicked. For example, if you have event handlers for the xtd::forms::control::click and xtd::forms::control::double_click events of a xtd::forms::form, the xtd::forms::control::click and xtd::forms::control::double_click events are raised when the form is double-clicked and both methods are called. If a control is double-clicked and that control does not support the xtd::forms::control::double_click event, the xtd::forms::control::click event might be raised twice.
      /// @remarks You must set the standard_click value of xtd::forms::control_styles to `true` for this event to be raised.
      /// @note The following events are not raised for the xtd::forms::tab_control class unless there is at least one xtd::forms::tab_page in the xtd::forms::tab_control. xtd::forms::tab_control::tab_pages collection: xtd::forms::control::click, xtd::forms::control::double_click, xtd::forms::control::mouse_down, xtd::forms::control::mouse_up, xtd::forms::control::mouse_hover, xtd::forms::control::mouse_enter, xtd::forms::control::mouse_leave and xtd::forms::control::mouse_move. If there is at least one xtd::forms::tab_page in the collection, and the user interacts with the tab control's header (where the xtd::forms::tab_page names appear), the xtd::forms::tab_control raises the appropriate event. However, if the user interaction is within the client area of the tab page, the xtd::forms::tab_page raises the appropriate event.
      /// @par Notes to Inheritors
      /// Inheriting from a standard Windows Forms control and changing the standard_click or standard_double_click values of xtd::forms::control_styles to `true` can cause unexpected behavior or have no effect at all if the control does not support the click or xtd::forms::control::double_click events.

      /// @brief Occurs when the xtd::forms::control is double-clicked.
      /// @remarks A double-click is determined by the mouse settings of the user's operating system. The user can set the time between clicks of a mouse button that should be considered a double-click rather than two clicks. The click event is raised every time a control is double-clicked. For example, if you have event handlers for the xtd::forms::control::click and xtd::forms::control::double_click events of a xtd::forms::form, the xtd::forms::control::click and xtd::forms::control::double_click events are raised when the form is double-clicked and both methods are called. If a control is double-clicked and that control does not support the xtd::forms::control::double_click event, the click event might be raised twice.
      /// @remarks You must set the standard_double_click and standard_click value of xtd::forms::control_styles to `true` for this event to be raised.
      /// @note The following events are not raised for the xtd::forms::tab_control class unless there is at least one xtd::forms::tab_page in the xtd::forms::tab_control. xtd::forms::tab_control::tab_pages collection: xtd::forms::control::click, xtd::forms::control::double_click, xtd::forms::control::mouse_down, xtd::forms::control::mouse_up, xtd::forms::control::mouse_hover, xtd::forms::control::mouse_enter, xtd::forms::control::mouse_leave and xtd::forms::control::mouse_move. If there is at least one xtd::forms::tab_page in the collection, and the user interacts with the tab control's header (where the xtd::forms::tab_page names appear), the xtd::forms::tab_control raises the appropriate event. However, if the user interaction is within the client area of the tab page, the xtd::forms::tab_page raises the appropriate event.

      /// Inheriting from a standard Windows Forms control and changing the standard_click or standard_double_click values of xtd::forms::control_styles to `true` can cause unexpected behavior or have no effect at all if the control does not support the xtd::forms::control::click or xtd::forms::control::double_click events.

      /// @remarks When handling the xtd::forms::control::mouse_wheel event it is important to follow the user interface (UI) standards associated with the mouse wheel. The mouse_event_args::delta property value indicates the amount the mouse wheel has been moved. The UI should scroll when the accumulated delta is plus or minus 120. The UI should scroll the number of logical lines returned by the system_information::mouse_wheel_scroll_lines property for every delta value reached. You can also scroll more smoothly in smaller that 120 unit increments, however the ratio should remain constant, that is system_information::mouse_wheel_scroll_lines lines scrolled per 120 delta units of wheel movement.
