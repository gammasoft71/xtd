    /// @remarks There are two ways to add a hyperlink to the text of a xtd::forms::link_label control. You can access the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection::push_back method of the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection class through the xtd::forms::link_label::links property of the xtd::forms::link_label to add multiple hyperlinks to the control's text. If you only need to add a single hyperlink to the text of the control, you can use the xtd::forms::link_label::link_area property of the xtd::forms::link_label. This property accepts a xtd::forms::link_area that defines the location of the hyperlink within the control's text. When a hyperlink is specified using the xtd::forms::link_label::link_area property, the link area is then added to the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection in the same manner as adding the link using the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection::push_back method of the xtd::forms::link_label::link_collection.
    /// @remarks The xtd::forms::link_area::length property specifies the number of characters within the text of the xtd::forms::link_label to include in the link area. The xtd::forms::link_area::start property specifies the first character in the control text to include in the hyperlink. If you want to determine whether a specific xtd::forms::link_area is empty, you can use the xtd::forms::link_area::is_empty property instead of checking the values of the xtd::form::link_area::start and xtd::form::link_area::length properties.
