    /// @remarks A xtd::forms::key_press_event_args specifies the character that is composed when the user presses a key. For example, when the user presses SHIFT + K, the key_char property returns an uppercase K.
    /// @remarks A xtd::forms::control::key_press event occurs when the user presses a key. Two events that are closely related to the xtd::forms::control::key_press event are xtd::forms::control::key_up and xtd::forms::control::key_down. The xtd::forms::control::key_down event precedes each xtd::forms::control::key_press event when the user presses a key, and a xtd::forms::control::key_up event occurs when the user releases a key. When the user holds down a key, duplicate xtd::forms::control::key_down and xtd::forms::control::key_press events occur each time the character repeats. One xtd::forms::control::key_up event is generated upon release.
    /// @remarks With each xtd::forms::control::key_press event, a xtd::forms::key_press_event_args is passed. A key_event_args is passed with each xtd::forms::control::key_down and xtd::forms::control::key_up event. A key_event_args specifies whether any modifier keys (CMD, CTRL, SHIFT, or ALT) were pressed along with another key. (This modifier information can also be obtained through the modifier_keys property of the control class.)
    /// @remarks Set handled to true to cancel the xtd::forms::control::key_press event. This keeps the control from processing the key press.
    /// @note Some controls will process certain key strokes on xtd::forms::control::key_down. For example, rich_text_box processes the Enter key before xtd::forms::control::key_press is called. In such cases, you cannot cancel the xtd::forms::control::key_press event, and must cancel the key stroke from xtd::forms::control::key_down instead.
