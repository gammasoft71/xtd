    /// @remarks When you retrieve the value of the `RightToLeft` property from xtd::forms::context_menu, xtd::forms::main_menu, and xtd::forms::progress_bar you will get the value of xtd::forms::right_to_left you assigned. In contrast, if you are deriving your own class from xtd::forms::control, and you assign a value of Inherit to the xtd::forms::control::right_to_left property, the value returned will be the setting of the xtd::forms::control::right_to_left property of the parent control. If there is no parent control, it will return a value of xtd::forms::right_to_left::no. Otherwise, it will return a value of xtd::forms::right_to_left::yes or xtd::forms::right_to_left::no, depending on the value that you assigned to the xtd::forms::control::right_to_left property of your derived class.
