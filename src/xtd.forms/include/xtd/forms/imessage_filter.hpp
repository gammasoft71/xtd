    /// @remarks A class that implements the imessage_filter interface can be added to the application's message pump to filter out a message or perform other operations before the message is dispatched to a form or control. To add the message filter to an application's message pump, use the add_message_filter method in the application class.

For example, to stop the click event of a button control from being dispatched to the control, you implement the pre_filter_message method and return a true value when the click message occurs. You can also use this method to perform code work that you might need to do before the message is dispatched.
