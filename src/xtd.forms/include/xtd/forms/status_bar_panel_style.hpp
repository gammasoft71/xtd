    /// @remarks The toolbar button appearance is determined by the xtd::forms::tool_bar::appearance property of the toolbar. Setting the xtd::forms::tool_bar::appearance property to xtd::forms::tool_bar_appearance::flat will give the toolbar and its buttons a flat appearance. As the mouse pointer moves over the buttons, they take on a three-dimensional appearance. Also, when the toolbar has a flat appearance, button separators appear as a line rather than as a space between the buttons.
