    /// @remarks This enumeration has a flags  attribute that allows a bitwise combination of its member values.
    /// @remarks Controls use this enumeration in various properties and methods to specify functionality. A control can enable a style by calling the set_style method and passing in the appropriate control_styles bit (or bits) and the bool value to set the bit(s) to. For example, the following line code would enable double-buffering.
    /// ```cpp
    /// my_control.set_style(control_styles::user_paint | control_styles::all_painting_in_wm_paint | double_buffer, true);
    /// ```
    /// @remarks If the all_painting_in_wm_paint bit is set to true, the window message WM_ERASEBKGND is ignored, and both on_paint_background and on_paint methods are called directly from the window message WM_PAINT. This generally reduces flicker unless other controls send the window message WM_ERASEBKGND to the control. You might send the window message WM_ERASEBKGRND to achieve a pseudo-transparent effect similar to supports_transparent_back_color; for example, a tool_bar with flat appearance does this.
    /// @remarks To fully enable double-buffering, you can set the optimized_double_buffer and all_painting_in_wm_paint bits to true. However the preferred method for enabling double buffering, which yields the same result, is to set the double_buffered property for the control to true.
    /// @remarks If the supports_transparent_back_color bit is set to true, and the back_color is set to a color whose alpha component is less than 255, on_paint_background will simulate transparency by asking its parent control to paint the background. This is not true transparency.
    /// @note If there is another control between the control and its parent, the current control will not show the control in the middle.
    /// @remarks When the user_mouse bit is set to true, the following methods are still called: control::on_mouse_down, control::on_mouse_up, control::on_mouse_enter, control::on_mouse_move, control::on_mouse_hover, control::on_mouse_leave, and control::on_mouse_wheel.
    /// @remarks When the control is clicked, if the standard_click bit is set to true the control::on_click method is called and it raises the control::click event. When the control is double-clicked, and both the standard_click and standard_double_click bits are set to true, the click is passed on to the xtd::forms::control::double_click event. Then the Control::on_double_click method is called and it raises the control::double_click event. However, the control can call on_click or on_double_click directly regardless of the standard_click and standard_double_click bit values. For more information on control click and double click behaviors, see the control::click and control::double_click topics.
    /// @remarks When the use_text_for_accessibility bit is set and there is a value in the control's text property, the value of that control's text property determines the control's default active accessibility name and shortcut key. Otherwise, the text of the preceding label control will be used instead. This style is set by default. Certain built-in control types, such as text_box and combo_box, reset this style so that the text property of those controls will not be used by active accessibility.
