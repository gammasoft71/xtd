    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics class allows you to implement custom double buffering for your graphics. It provides a wrapper for a graphics buffer, along with methods that you can use to write to the buffer and render its contents to an output device.
    /// @remarks Graphics that use double buffering can reduce or eliminate flicker that is caused by redrawing a display surface. When you use double buffering, updated graphics are first drawn to a buffer in memory, and the contents of this buffer are then quickly written to some or all of the displayed surface. This relatively brief overwrite of the displayed graphics typically reduces or eliminates the flicker that sometimes occurs when graphics are updated.
    /// @note The simplest way to use double buffering is to set the xtd::forms::control_styles::optimized_double_buffer control style flag on a control using the xtd::control::set_style method. Setting the xtd::forms::control_styles::optimized_double_buffer flag for a control redirects all painting for the control through a default graphics buffer, without requiring any additional code. This flag is set to @verbatim true @endverbatim by default.
    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics class has no public constructor and must be created by the xtd::drawing::bffered_graphics_context for an application domain using its xtd::drawing::bffered_graphics_context::allocate method. You can retrieve the xtd::drawing::::buffered_graphics_context for the current application domain from the static xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_manager::current property.
    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::graphics property can be used for drawing to the graphics buffer. This property provides access to the xtd::drawing::graphics object that draws to the graphics buffer allocated for this xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics object.
    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics::render method with no arguments draws the contents of the graphics buffer to the surface specified when the buffer was allocated. Other overloads of the xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics::render method allow you to specify a xtd::drawing::graphics object or an xtd::intptr type that points to a device context to which to draw the contents of the graphics buffer.
