    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_context class allows you to implement custom double buffering for your graphics. Graphics that use double buffering can reduce or eliminate flicker that is caused by redrawing a display surface.
    /// @note The simplest way to use double buffering is to set the xtd::forms::control_styles::optimized_double_buffer control style flag on a control using the xtd::forms::control::set_style method. Setting the xtd::forms::control_styles::optimized_double_buffer control styles flag for a control redirects all painting for the control through a default graphics buffer, without requiring any additional code. This flag is set to true by default.
    /// @remarks The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_context class provides methods for creating and configuring a graphics buffer. The xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_context::allocate method creates a xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics, which is a wrapper for a graphics buffer that also provides methods you can use to write to the buffer and render its contents to an output device.
    /// @remarks You can retrieve the xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_context for the current application domain from the static xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_manager::current property. For graphically intensive applications such as animation, you can create a dedicated xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_context using the constructor, but for most applications the xtd::drawing::buffered_graphics_manager::current property will be sufficient.
