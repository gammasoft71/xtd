# math

This example uses several mathematical and trigonometric functions from the [xtd::math](https://gammasoft71.github.io/xtd/reference_guides/latest/classxtd_1_1math.html) class to calculate the inner angles of a trapezoid.

## Sources

* [src/math.cpp](src/math.cpp)
* [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)

## Build and run

Open "Command Prompt" or "Terminal". Navigate to the folder that contains the project and type the following:

```cmake
xtdc run
```

## Output

```
The trapezoid's bases are 20.0 and 10.0, the trapezoid's legs are 8.0 and 6.0
trapezoid height is: 4.8
trapezoid left base angle is: 0.64 Radians
trapezoid right base angle is: 0.93 Radians
trapezoid left base angle is: 36.67 Degrees
trapezoid left base angle is: 53.29 Degrees
```
