```
foo {42}.compare_to(foo {42}) = 0
foo {42}.compare_to(foo {41}) = 1
foo {42}.compare_to(foo {43}) = -1

foo {42} <=> foo {42} = equivalent
foo {42} <=> foo {41} = greater
foo {42} <=> foo {43} = less

foo {42} <= foo {42} = true
foo {42} <= foo {41} = false
foo {42} <= foo {43} = true

foo {42} < foo {42} = false
foo {42} < foo {41} = false
foo {42} < foo {43} = true

foo {42} >= foo {42} = true
foo {42} >= foo {41} = true
foo {42} >= foo {43} = false

foo {42} > foo {42} = false
foo {42} > foo {41} = true
foo {42} > foo {43} = false
